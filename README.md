This is my tutorial "Understanding Significance Testing as the Quantification of Contradiction: Conceptual and Practical Foundations of Statistics in the Context of Experimental Research".

It's not really an introductory stand-alone textbook, but it does try to provide a grasp of the fundamental concepts, via text and programming simulations. I think it might be useful for students with a more than average interest in the materials to read alongside undergraduate modules, and for researchers grappling with the issues surrounding null hypothesis significance testing.

It assumes you have Python installed and the ability to write simple programs in it.
